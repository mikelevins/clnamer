clnamer is a vanilla Common Lisp version of the simple name-generator
program that I often use to experiment with new programming
languages. This software is not intended to be especially useful,
except in the way I use it: as a very simple and yet nontrivial
program for exploring the capabilities of programming languages.

On the other hand, it can be good for a laugh with the right inputs.
